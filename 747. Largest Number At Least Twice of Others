/*
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 is trivially at least twice the value as any other number because there are no other numbers.
